## 📊 Key Insights & Visualizations  

### 🔍 Dashboard 1: Business Overview  

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/270e5fdb-d93f-4bf2-8daf-ecc81a07493f)


#### 📌 Overall Business Performance

**Observation:**  

- Revenue increases steadily from 2011 to 2014, showing strong business growth.

- Profit also rises, but not always at the same speed as revenue, which may indicate pressure on profit margin.

- Profit margin reaches its highest point around 2013 and then decreases slightly, possibly due to higher costs or more discounting.

- Total orders grow every year, showing increasing customer demand.

- The number of returns also increases over time, which can reduce overall profit if not managed well.

- Revenue comes from multiple markets (APAC, EU, US, LATAM, EMEA), helping the company avoid relying too much on one region.

**Recommendation:**  

- ✔️ Focus not only on revenue growth but also on maintaining healthy profit margins.

- ✔️ Review costs and discount policies to understand what is affecting margin performance.

- ✔️ Improve product strategy by promoting higher-margin products where possible.

- ✔️ Improve return management processes to reduce losses and protect profitability.

- ✔️ Expand more in markets that show both strong growth and good profit margins to improve long-term results.


### 📦 Dashboard 2: Product Analysis  

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41174e5d-999c-436c-a73c-2e9a77dc0353)


#### 📌 Product Analysis 

**Observation:**  

- Phones and Copiers generate the highest revenue and profit, making them the key revenue drivers. Copiers show a particularly strong profit margin (around 17%), indicating good pricing power.

- Chairs and Bookcases generate high revenue but lower margin compared to Copiers, suggesting higher costs or heavier discounting.

- Some sub-categories such as Tables and Accessories show relatively weaker profit performance, even though revenue is moderate. This may indicate inefficient cost control.

- The Top 10 products are dominated by smartphones and technology-related items, confirming that Technology is a strategic category.

- The scatter plot shows that most markets generate positive profit, but at least one market has negative profit despite having orders, which is a warning sign.

- Return rate is relatively high in some sub-categories (over 30–50%), which can significantly reduce net profit if not managed carefully.

**Recommendation:**  

- ✔️ Prioritize high-margin sub-categories like Copiers and Phones in marketing and expansion strategies.

- ✔️ Review pricing and cost structure of low-margin products (e.g., Tables, Accessories) to improve profitability.

- ✔️ Strengthen inventory and demand planning for top-performing products to avoid stock shortages.

- ✔️ Carefully analyze markets with negative or low profit despite strong order volume to identify pricing or operational issues.

- ✔️ Implement stricter return policies or improve product quality and descriptions to reduce high return rates.

- ✔️ Focus future product strategy on Technology-related items, as they show strong revenue contribution and competitive margins.

### 🌍 Dashboard 3: Market Analysis  

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91cacb29-8f55-4fd4-922f-239ad0ca263f)


#### 📌 Market Analysis

**Observation:**  

- APAC and EU generate the highest revenue, making them the main contributors to overall sales performance.

- EMEA shows strong Year-over-Year growth, even though its total revenue is lower than APAC and EU. This indicates high growth potential.

- Africa has a high profit margin compared to some larger markets, suggesting efficient cost control or strong pricing strategy.

- Canada has very low revenue and customer volume, contributing minimally to overall performance.

- The number of customers is relatively stable across major markets (APAC, EU, LATAM, US), showing balanced market coverage.

- Revenue growth rate varies by region, meaning expansion performance is not equally distributed.

- Top sales agents contribute significantly to revenue, indicating that sales performance is partly driven by key individuals.

**Recommendation:**  

- ✔️ Maintain strong investment and customer retention strategies in APAC and EU, as they are core revenue markets.

- ✔️ Prioritize expansion in EMEA, where growth rate is high and future potential looks promising.

- ✔️ Study the Africa market model to understand how it maintains higher profit margin and apply best practices to other regions.

- ✔️ Re-evaluate strategy in Canada, considering whether to restructure, reposition, or limit investment.

- ✔️ Develop training and incentive programs to scale the performance of top sales agents across other teams.

- ✔️ Allocate resources based on both revenue size and profit margin, not revenue alone, to maximize long-term ROI.
